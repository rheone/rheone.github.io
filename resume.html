         <p><i>With over eighteen years of experience as a professional software developer, I have provided support to
               the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) in
               mission-critical activities. I have spent the last eleven years at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL),
               and previously worked at the Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC). I have led multiple projects
               and teams of developer and software adjacent positions, gaining a wide range of experience and technical
               skills across various specialized disciplines, software domains, and integrated systems. My work has had
               a positive impact on software development and architectural implementation at the laboratories, as well
               as cyber security posture, network topology, and laboratory software systems. I have been instrumental in
               fostering Agile methodologies, leading software development teams, mentoring interns, and staff members,
               and providing guidance on development best practices and Computer Science related solutions. I am
               recognized as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) and have regularly engaged with laboratory and non-laboratory
               staff at conferences, presenting on a variety of topics. My expertise in software development has
               influenced internal practices and procedures. I am the lead developer for three open-source software
               packages and have been heavily involved in the creation of several products shared within the DOE/NNSA
               ecosystem through the Government Use Notice (G.U.N.) process. My engagement in the software development
               and team leads disciplines have been both personally rewarding and has shaped the perspectives of others
