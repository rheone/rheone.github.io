            <hr>
            <p>With over 18 years of experience as a professional software developer, I have provided critical support
               to the
               National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) in mission-critical
               activities. I have spent the last decade at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and previously worked at
               the
               Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC). I have led multiple projects and teams of developer and
               developer
               adjacent positions, gaining a wide range of experience and technical skills across various specialized
               disciplines, software domains, and integrated systems. My work has had a positive impact on software
               development
               and architectural implementation at the laboratories, as well as on cyber security posture, network
               topology,
               and laboratory software systems. I have been instrumental in fostering Agile methodology, leading
               software
               development teams, mentoring interns, and staff members, and providing guidance on best practices and
               Computer
               Science solutions. I am recognized as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) and have regularly engaged with
               laboratory
               and non-laboratory staff at conferences, presenting on a variety of topics. My expertise in software
               development
               has influenced practices and procedures. I am the lead developer for three open-source software packages
               and
               have been heavily involved in the creation of several products shared with the DOE/NNSA ecosystem through
               the
               Government Use Notice (G.U.N.) process. My engagement in the development discipline has been both
               personally
               rewarding and has shaped the perspectives of others.</p>
