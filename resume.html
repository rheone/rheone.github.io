            <hr>
            <p>I have been a professional software developer for over sixteen years aiding the National Nuclear Security
               Administration (NNSA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) in mission critical activities. My recent
               decade-long tenure has been at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and prior to that, I worked for the
               Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC). I have led multiple projects and teams and gathered a wide
               range of experience and technical skills spanning several specialized disciplines, software domains, and
               integrated systems. My work has positively affected software development and architectural practices at
               the laboratories in addition to impacting cyber security posture, network topology, and other laboratory
               software systems. I&#39;ve been involved with fostering Agile practices, leading software development
               teams, educating and mentoring interns and staff members, as well as providing guidance on best
               practices. I am sought out as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) and have regularly engaged with laboratory
               and non-laboratory staff at conferences and presented on a variety of topics. My expertise in software
               development has influenced practices and procedures. I am the lead developer for three open-source
               software packages and heavily involved with the creation of several products shared with the DOE/NNSA
               ecosystem through the Government Use Notice (G.U.N.) process. My engagement in the development discipline
               has been both personally enriching and shaped the perspective of others.</p>
